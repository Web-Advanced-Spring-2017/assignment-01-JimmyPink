# Assignment 01

**TODO List**
- This is my Wicked To Do List.
- My "To do" tasks are inputed into the space that says "enter your to do...".
- Once the task is entered the "ADD" button located below the entered task must be pressed
- After the add button is pressed the "to do" task will apper below the "TO DO" title.
- Next to each task there are two buttons, "EDIT", which allows for editing the task and "DELETE" which allows for deletion of the task.
- All tasks will appear in the order that they were added with the first one added being at the top.
- If the "ADD" button was pressed without a to do task entered an alert message will pop-up letting the person know that a to o task was not entered.
